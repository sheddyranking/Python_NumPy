# Python_NumPy
Everything you need to know about NumPy( Creating Arrays, Indexing, Math,Statistics,Reshaping).

## Why NumPy instead of List?.
Numby is Faster, while List are slow.

### Why is Numby Faster?
1. Fixed Type.
- Faster to Read Less Bytes of Memory.
- No Type checking when Iterating through Objects.

2. Utilize Contiguous Memory. 
- SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) Vector Processing.
- Effective Cache Utilization.

## Aplication of NumPy.
1. Mathematics (MATHLAB Replacement).
2. Plotting (Matplotlib)
3. Backend(Pandas, Connect4, Digital Photography)
4. Machine Learning.
